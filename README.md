<!-- 
Hi there! This is your new README. The most important thing you can do now is create the visual assets.
1.  **Banner:** Use Canva or Figma to create a header image (1280x400px is a good size).
2.  **Project GIFs:** Use a tool like ScreenToGif or Kap to record short, looping videos of your projects in action. This is the most impactful part!

## üìö Knowledge Sharing & Tutorials
I believe in learning by teaching. I'm currently creating tutorials to share my knowledge with the community.

- **LangGraph Tutorials:** A deep dive into building complex, agentic AI systems with cycles and state management. `[Coming Soon]`
- **RAG From Scratch:** A hands-on guide to building and optimizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipelines using Qdrant and open-source embedding models. `[Coming Soon]`

---

## üå± What I'm Currently Exploring

- Diving deep into multi-modal RAG techniques.
- Exploring the low-level mechanics of autodiff by completing exercises in `tinygrad`.
- Finishing Andrej Karpathy's "Neural Networks: Zero to Hero" to solidify my foundational knowledge.
